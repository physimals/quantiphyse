Quantiphyse is a visualisation and analysis tool for 3D and 4D biomedical data. It is particularly suited 
for physiological or functional imaging timeseries data. 

Quantiphyse is built around the concept of making spatially 
resolved measurements of physical or physiological processes from imaging data using 
model-based or model-free methods, often exploiting Bayesian inference techniques.

Quantiphyse can analyse data by voxels or within regions of interest that may be manually or 
automatically created, e.g. using supervoxel or clustering methods.
