qBOLD Tutorial
==============

Introduction
------------

The aim of this practical is to provide an overview of Bayesian model-based analysis [1]_
of Quantitative BOLD, or qBOLD, data. We will work with healthy human data [2]_ to quantify 
the reversible transverse relaxation rate (:math:`R_2^\prime`), the oxygen extraction 
fraction (OEF) and the deoxygenated blood volume (DBV). 

This data was acquired using a GESEPI ASE (Gradient Echo Slice Excitation Profile Imaging 
Asymmetric Spin Echo) pulse sequence [3]_, which deals with the three major confounding 
effects of qBOLD:

  1. Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) signal contamination
  2. Macroscopic magnetic field inhomogeneity
  3. Underlying transverse T2 signal decay. 
  
However, there are several other ways to acquire qBOLD data including 
standard ASE [4]_ and the GESSE (Gradient Echo Sampling of Spin Echo) pulse sequence [5]_. 
This tool might also be useful for analysing data from these techniques if the aforementioned 
confounds can be removed in pre-processing, although this has not been tested. 

Basic Orientation
-----------------

Before we do any data modelling, this is a quick orientation guide to Quantiphyse if you've 
not used it before. You can skip this section if you already know how the program works.

Start the program by typing ``quantiphyse`` at a command prompt, or clicking on the Quantiphyse
icon |qp| in the menu or dock.

.. |qp| image:: /screenshots/qp_logo.png 
    :scale: 40%

Loading some qBOLD Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are taking part in an organized practical workshop, the data required may be available in your home
directory, in the ``course_data/qbold`` folder.

.. note:: 
    If the data is not provided, it can be can be downloaded from the Oxford 
    Research Archive site: https://doi.org/10.5287/bodleian:E24JbXQwO 
    (Click the link ``streamlined-qBOLD_stud…`` to download a compressed archive of the data).

Start by loading the qBOLD data into Quantiphyse - use ``File->Load Data`` or drag and drop to load the file 
``sub-01_sqbold_gase.nii.gz`` in the ``sub-01/func`` folder. In the Load Data dialog select Data.

.. image:: /screenshots/qbold/drag_drop_choice.png

The data should appear as follows:

.. image:: /screenshots/qbold/data_loaded.png

Image view
~~~~~~~~~~

The left part of the window normally contains three orthogonal views of your data. In this case the data is a 2D slice so Quantiphyse has maximised the
relevant viewing window. If you double click on the view it returns to the standard of three orthogonal views - this can be used with 3D data to look at just one of the slice windows at a time.

 - Left mouse click to select a point of focus using the crosshairs
 - Left mouse click and drag to pan the view
 - Right mouse click and drag to zoom
 - Mouse wheel to move through the slices
 - Double click to 'maximise' a view, or to return to the triple view from the maximised view.

View and navigation controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just below the viewer these controls allow you to move the point of focus and also change 
the view parameters for the current ROI and overlay.

Widgets
~~~~~~~

The right hand side of the window contains 'widgets' - tools for analysing and processing data.
Three are visible at startup:

 - ``Volumes`` provides an overview of the data sets you have loaded
 - ``Data statistics`` displays summary statistics for data set
 - ``Voxel analysis`` displays timeseries and overlay data at the point of focus

Select a widget by clicking on its tab, just to the right of the image viewer. 

More widgets can be found in the ``Widgets`` menu at the top of the window. The tutorial
will tell you when you need to open a new widget.

For a slightly more detailed introduction, see the :ref:`getting_started` section of the
User Guide.

Pre-processing
--------------

Slice Averaging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GESEPI ASE pulse sequence mitigates the effect of magnetic field inhomogeneity by phase 
encoding each 5 mm slice into four 1.25 mm sub-slices. To improve SNR these sub-slices are 
averaged together. So in the case of the data we are analysing here, the original 40 slices 
are reduced to 10 slices. Due to a 2.5 mm slice gap between the slices the NIFTI header reports 
the slice thickness as 7.5 mm. The data suppplied in ``course data`` has already had slice
averaging performed.

.. note::
    To perform slice averaging on the raw data you can use a command line script ``zaverage.sh``,
    for example: ``zaverage.sh sub-01_task-csfnull_rec-filtered_ase sub-01_sqbold_gase``

Brain Extraction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For clinical data, we recommend brain extraction is performed as a preliminary step using FSL’s BET tool [6]_, with the 
``–m`` option set to create a binary mask and the -Z option to improve the brain extraction due to the small number of slices. 
Using a brain ROI is strongly recommended as this will decrease processing time considerably. 

In this case we will perform brain extraction from within Quantiphyse. We do not currently support the ``-Z`` option so
we will adjust the threshold to get a reasonable result.

Before brain extraction we will need to take the mean of the 4D data as Bet can only run on a 3D image. To do this we can use the
``Processing->Simple Maths`` widget which allows us to do simple operations on data sets, similar to FSL maths. Select the
4D qBOLD data and enter the following expression:

.. image:: /screenshots/qbold/mean_data.png

If you know Python and Numpy you will recognize this code - we can use any simple Numpy expression in the widget.

Now, from the ``Widgets`` menu select ``FSL->BET`` and then as input data choose the mean data we have just generated.
Check the ``Output brain mask`` option so we get a binary ROI mask for the brain and change the intensity threshold value to 0.4.

.. image:: /screenshots/qbold/bet.png

Click ``Run`` and an ROI should be generated covering the brain and displayed as follows:

.. image:: /screenshots/qbold/brain.png

When viewing the output of modelling, it may be clearer if the ROI is displayed as an outline, as shown in this screenshot, 
rather than a shaded region. To do this, click on the icon to the right of the ROI selector (below the image view):

.. image:: /screenshots/cest_tutorial_roi_contour.png

The icon cycles between display modes for the ROI: shaded (with variable transparency selected by the slider below), 
shaded and outlined, just outlined, or no display at all.

.. note::
    It is possible to generate the brain mask from within Quantiphyse using the FSL integration plugin. We have not done
    this because the plugin does not currently support the -Z option and because it is necessary to take a the mean
    of the qBOLD timeseries before performing brain extraction

.. note::
    If you accidentally load an ROI data set as ``Data``, you can set it to be an ROI using the ``Volumes`` widget
    (visible by default). Just click on the data set in the list and click the ``Toggle ROI`` button.

Motion Correction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Motion correction can be implemented using FSL's MCFLIRT tool within Quantiphyse, or beforehand using FSL or another
tool. To run within Quantiphyse, select ``Widgets`` ->  ``Registration`` -> ``Registration``. 

To run motion correction on the data, you need to:

  - Set the registration mode to ``Motion Correction``
  - Ensure the method is set to ``FLIRT/MCFLIRT``
  - Select ``sub-01_sqbold_gase`` as the ``Moving data``
  - Select the reference volume as ``Specified volume``
  - For GESEPI ASE data we’ll use the spin echo (tau=0) image, which in this case is image 7, so we have set
    ``Index of reference volume`` to 7
  - The output name can be left as the default: ``sub-01_sqbold_gase_reg``

The resulting setup should look like this:

.. image:: /screenshots/qbold/moco.png

Click ``Run`` to run the motion correction. The output in this case is not very different from the input - you may be
able to see some small differences, by switching between ``sub-01_sqbold_gase`` and ``sub-01_sqbold_gase_reg`` in the 
verlay selector (below the image view). You can also see differences using the ``Voxel Analysis`` widget - see below.

Data Smoothing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To suppress isolated noisy voxels we perform sub-voxel smoothing using the widget built in to Quantiphyse. 
From the menu select ``Widgets->Processing->Smoothing`` and set the options to smooth ``sub-01_sqbold_gase_reg`` with 
a smoothing kernel of 1.5 mm. This value is equivalent to smoothing with a full width half maximum equal to 
the in-plane voxel dimension of 3.75 mm (FWHM ≈ 2.355 σ).

.. image:: /screenshots/qbold/smooth.png

Visualising Data
----------------

Select the ``Voxel Analysis`` widget which is visible by default to the right of the viewing window. Try clicking 
on different voxels in the cortical grey matter to see the qBOLD signal curve: 
  
.. image:: /screenshots/qbold/signal.png

You can see the relatively subtle effect the motion correction and smoothing have had on the data. The checkboxes
in the ``Timeseries Data`` list can be used to show and hide data sets from the timeseries plot.

Bayesian Model-based Analysis 
-----------------------------

To analyse qBOLD data using Bayesian model fitting, select the Quantitative BOLD tool from the menu: 
``Widgets->BOLD MRI->Quantitative BOLD``. The widget should look something like this:

.. image:: /screenshots/qbold/widget.png

Data and sequence section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To begin with, make sure the ``sub-01_sqbold_gase_reg_smoothed`` data set is selected as the qBOLD data, 
and the ``sub-01_sqbold_gase_mean_brain_mask`` brain mask is selected as the ROI.

Next we will specify the spin echo displacement times, or Taus - they represent the different 
:math:`R_2^\prime` weightings acquired in the data set. You can enter them manually, or if they are stored in a 
text file (e.g. with one value per row) you can drag and drop the file onto the entry widget.

For this tutorial we have provided the Tau values in the file ``tau_values.txt`` which is in the ``sub-01`` folder, 
so click Load, select this file and verify that the values are as shown in the screenshot below.

Now set the echo time (TE) of the acquired data - in this case it is 0.074 s - and the repetition time (TR) - 
which is 3 s. In order to remove the confounding effect of CSF a FLAIR preparation is used to null the 
CSF signal. This value is set based on the TR and the T1 of CSF (3817 ms), which gives an inversion time 
(TI) of 1210 ms, or 1.21s. 

The sequence parameters should appear as follows:

.. image:: /screenshots/qbold/sequence.png

Model Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: /screenshots/qbold/infer_r2p.png

The default options are ``Infer modified T2 rate rather than OEF`` and ``Infer deoxygenated blood volume``. The latter 
ensures that DBV is mapped on a voxel by voxel basis rather than using a fixed value and the former causes the model 
to estimate :math:`R_2^\prime` and DBV rather than OEF and DBV. This is an important point in the fitting of qBOLD data. 
It has been shown that OEF and DBV are relatively colinear in the parameter space meaning that a unique solution is 
difficult to find [1]_, [7]_. In contrast, :math:`R_2^\prime` and DBV have much lower correlation providing the 
opportunity to accurately estimate both simultaneously. 

.. image:: /screenshots/qbold/oef_vs_r2p.png

*M. T. Cherukara, A. J. Stone, M. A. Chappell, and N. P. Blockley, "Model-Based Bayesian Inference of Brain Oxygenation 
Using Quantitative BOLD" Neuroimage, In Press, 2019. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116106. Published by Elsevier and

This figure shows the results of a grid-search posterior sampling on simulated ASE qBOLD data.
(a) shows the posterior probability of OEF-DBV parameter pairs with the true values shown by the black cross-hair. 
(b) show the posterior probability of R2′-DBV pairs using the same simulated data. In the OEF-DBV model, there is a large 
area of collinearity, and the posterior density distribution does not have a Gaussian-like form. By contrast, the 
R2′-DBV model has more separable parameters, and a distribution shape that can more easily be approximated by a 
multivariate normal distribution, which is a requirement for the variational Bayes inference methods used by this tool. 

When data does not include a FLAIR preparation to null CSF, ``Include CSF compartment`` can be checked. In this case you 
will be presented with further options to Infer the CSF frequency shift and Infer CSF fractional volume. 

.. image:: /screenshots/qbold/csf.png

Since there is very little information regarding CSF in the GESEPI ASE data we are using, care should be taken when using these options 
and it is likely that using a fixed value of frequency shift (unchecking Infer the CSF frequency shift) would be the most 
likely option. If you would like to experiment with these options the data set linked above also includes GESEPI ASE data 
without FLAIR (``sub-01_task-nonull_rec-filtered_ase``).

Finally, the qBOLD model was derived to account only for extravascular signal. It is possible to add a second intravascular 
compartment to the analysis by checking ``Include intravascular compartment``. 

.. image:: /screenshots/qbold/intravasc.png

The standard model utilises the powder model used in the original qBOLD paper [5]_. An alternative is the motional narrowing 
model which utilises an alternative model of the intravascular signal [8]_. In general, the intravascular signal has a weak 
effect on the final results, but may be valuable in regions of the brain with intermediate DBV fractions i.e. not very high 
or very low.

Model fitting options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, ``Spatial regularization`` is selected. This will reduce the appearance of noise in the final parameter maps using 
adaptive smoothing within the Bayesian framework in which the information present in the signal determines the degree of 
spatial smoothing. Fine detail in the output is only preserved if the information in the data justifies it.

Running the analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Run button is used to start the analysis. The output data will be loaded into Quantiphyse as the following data sets:

 - ``mean_r2p`` - Mean value of :math:`R_2^\prime` predicted by the Bayesian modelling
 - ``mean_dbv`` - Mean value of DBV predicted by the Bayesian modelling
 - ``mean_sig0`` - Mean offset signal predicted by the Bayesian modelling
 - ``modelfit`` - Predicted signal timeseries for comparison with the actual data

Visualising Processed Data
--------------------------

If you re-select the ``Voxel analysis`` widget which we used at the start to look at the qBOLD signal in the 
input data, you can see the model prediction overlaid onto the data. By clicking on different voxels you
can get an idea of how well the model has fitted your data.

.. image:: /screenshots/qbold/modelfit.png

Parameter map values at the selected voxel are also displayed in Voxel Analysis. The various parameter maps can be
selected for viewing from the Volumes widget, or using the overlay selector below the image viewer. This is 
the DBV output for this data:

.. image:: /screenshots/qbold/mean_dbv.png

To make this map visualisation clearer we have set the colour map range to 0-1 by clicking on the levels button |levels|
in the view options section, below the main viewer window. We have also selected the brain mask as the 'View ROI' which
means that the map is only displayed inside this ROI.

.. |levels| image:: /screenshots/overlay_levels.png

Estimating OEF when R2′-DBV has been performed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our default recommendation is to fit :math:`R_2^\prime` and DBV to the qBOLD data. Therefore, OEF is not an output of the 
model fitting procedure. Currently the maps of R2′ and DBV must be combined with tools such as fslmaths and the following equation:

:math:`OEF= \frac{3 \cdot R_2^\prime}{4\pi \cdot \gamma B_0 \cdot \Delta_{\chi_0} \cdot Hct \cdot DBV}`

where :math:`\gamma = 267.5 \times 10^6 \text{rad} s^{-1} T^{-1}``, :math:`B_0 = 3 T`, :math:`\Delta_{\chi_0} = 0.264 \text{ppm}`, and Hct 
is typically assumed to be 0.4. By combing these constants into a single constant :math:`c = 1.13 \times 10^{-3}`, we can simplify this 
equation to:

:math:`OEF=\frac{c \cdot R_2^\prime}{Hct \cdot DBV}`

You can perform this conversion in Quantiphyse using ``Widgets->Processing->Simple Maths`` as follows:

.. image:: /screenshots/qbold/oef_calc.png

Equivalently, this can be done using ``fslmaths`` as::

    fslmaths r2p-map -div dbv-map -mul 0.00113 -div 0.4 oef-map

.. note::
    ``fslmaths`` outputs zero for voxels outside the mask where there is a division by zero 
    whereas Quantiphyse will output a ``nan`` value here. To avoid this in quantiphyse you
    can instead use the expression ``np.nan_to_num((mean_r2p * 0.00113) / (0.4 * mean_dbv))``

The OEF map for this data appears as follows, again using a colormap range of 0-1 and displaying in the
ROI only:

.. image:: /screenshots/qbold/mean_oef.png
