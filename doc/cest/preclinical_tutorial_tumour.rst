QuantiCEST Tutorial
===================

Introduction
------------

This example aims to provide an overview of Bayesian model-based analysis for CEST [1]_ using the QuantiCEST widget [2]_
available as part of Quantiphyse [3]_. Here, we work with a preclinical tumour dataset using continuous 
wave CEST [4]_, however the following analysis pipeline should be applicable to both pulsed and continuous wave 
sequences acquired over a full Z-spectrum.  

Basic Orientation
-----------------

Before we do any data modelling, this is a quick orientation guide to Quantiphyse if you've 
not used it before. You can skip this section if you already know how the program works.

Start the program by typing ``quantiphyse`` at a command prompt, or clicking on the Quantiphyse
icon |qp| in the menu or dock.

Loading some CEST Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are taking part in an organized practical workshop, the data required may be available in your home
directory, in the ``course_data/cest/Preclinical/Tumour`` folder. If not, you will have been given instructions
on how to obtain the data from the course organizers.

You will need to load the following data file:

  - ``CEST.nii.gz``

.. image:: /screenshots/drag_drop_choice.png
    :align: right

Files can be loaded in NIFTI or DICOM format either by dragging and dropping in to the view pane, or by clicking 
``File`` -> ``Load Data``. When loading a file you should indicate if it is data or an ROI by clicking the 
appropriate button when the load dialog appears. 

The data should appear in the viewing window. 

.. image:: /screenshots/cest/tumour_data.png

.. note::
    This data is single slice and there is shown in a single 2D window. Sometimes single-slice timeseries data
    is (incorrectly) represented as a 3D NIFTI file, and would be displayed as such by quantiphyse. This should not be
    the case here, however if it occurs with other data files the problem can be corrected by selecting ``Advanced Options``
    when loading data and choosing ``Treat as 2D multi-volume``. 

Image view
~~~~~~~~~~

The left part of the window normally contains three orthogonal views of your data. In this case the data is a 2D slice so Quantiphyse has maximised the
relevant viewing window. If you double click on the view it returns to the standard of three orthogonal views - this can be used with 3D data to look at just one of the slice windows at a time.

 - Left mouse click to select a point of focus using the crosshairs
 - Left mouse click and drag to pan the view
 - Right mouse click and drag to zoom
 - Mouse wheel to move through the slices
 - Double click to 'maximise' a view, or to return to the triple view from the maximised view.

View and navigation controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just below the viewer these controls allow you to move the point of focus and also change 
the view parameters for the current ROI and overlay.

Widgets
~~~~~~~

The right hand side of the window contains 'widgets' - tools for analysing and processing data.
Three are visible at startup:

 - ``Volumes`` provides an overview of the data sets you have loaded
 - ``Data statistics`` displays summary statistics for data set
 - ``Voxel analysis`` displays timeseries and overlay data at the point of focus

Select a widget by clicking on its tab, just to the right of the image viewer. 

More widgets can be found in the ``Widgets`` menu at the top of the window. The tutorial
will tell you when you need to open a new widget.

For a slightly more detailed introduction, see the :ref:`getting_started` section of the
User Guide.

Pre-processing
--------------

Brain Extraction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For clinical data, we recommend brain extraction is performed as a preliminary step using FSL’s BET tool [5]_, with the 
``–m`` option set to create a binary mask. You can also do this from within Quantiphyse using the FSL integration
plugin. It is strongly recommended to include a brain ROI as this will decrease processing time considerably. 

In this case we have preclinical data for which BET is not optimised, so we have prepared the brain mask in advance 
in the following file:

  - ``mask.nii.gz``

Load this data set via the ``File`` menu, and his time select ``ROI`` as the data type. Once loaded, it will show up in the ``ROI`` 
dropdown under the viewing pane, and will also be visible as a blue shaded region on the CEST data:

.. image:: /screenshots/cest/tumour_roi.png

When viewing the output of modelling, it may be clearer if the ROI is displayed as an outline rather than a shaded
region. To do this, click on the icon |roi_view| to the right of the ROI selector (below the image view):

.. |roi_view| image:: /screenshots/roi_view_icon.png 

.. image:: /screenshots/cest_tutorial_roi_contour.png

The icon cycles between display modes for the ROI: shaded (with variable transparency selected by the slider below), 
shaded and outlined, just outlined, or no display at all.

.. note::
    If you accidentally load an ROI data set as ``Data``, you can set it to be an ROI using the ``Volumes`` widget
    (visible by default). Just click on the data set in the list and click the ``Toggle ROI`` button.

Visualising Data
----------------

Select the ``Voxel Analysis`` widget which is visible by default to the right of the viewing window. By
clicking on different voxels in the image the Z-spectra can be displayed:

Bayesian Model-based Analysis 
-----------------------------

To do CEST model analysis, select the QuantiCEST tool from the menu: ``Widgets -> CEST -> QuantiCEST``. The widget 
should look something like this:

.. image:: /screenshots/cest_tutorial_widget.png

Data and sequence section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To begin with, make sure the ``CEST`` data set is selected as the CEST data, and the ``mask``
ROI is selected as the ROI.

.. image:: /screenshots/cest_tutorial_sequence.png

The B0 field strength can be selected as 3T for clinical and 9.4T for preclinical studies. This selection
varies the pool defaults. If you choose ``Custom`` as the field strength as well as specifying 
the value you will need to adjust the pool defaults (see below).

In this case the acquisition parameters do not need altering, however in general you will need to 
specify the B1 field strength, saturation method and saturation time for your specific setup.

Next we will specify the frequency offsets of your acquisition - this is a set of frequences whose length
must match the number of volumes in the CEST data. You can enter them manually, or if they are stored in
a text file (e.g. with one value per row) you can click the ``Load`` button and choose the file. 

For this tutorial we have provided the frequency offsets in the
file ``Frequency_offsets.txt`` in the ``cest/Preclinical`` folder, so click ``Load``, select this file and verify 
that the values are as follows:

.. image:: /screenshots/cest_tutorial_freqs.png

Pool specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: /screenshots/cest_tutorial_pools.png

In general, a minimum of three pools should be included in model-based analysis. We provide some of the most common 
pools to include, along with literature values for frequency offset, exchange rate, and T1 and T2 values for the 
field strengths of 3T and 9.4T. The data for the pools we have selected can be displayed by clicking the ``Edit``
button:

.. image:: /screenshots/cest_tutorial_edit_pools.png

You can also use this dialog box to change the values, for example if you are using a custom field strength. The
``Add`` button can also be used if you want to use a pool that isn't one of the ones provided.

Analysis section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the analysis section we have the option of allowing the T1/T2 values to vary. We will enable this, but provide
T1 and T2 maps to guide the modelling. These maps are stored in the following files:

  - ``T1map.nii``
  - ``T2map.nii``

Load both of these files into Quantiphyse using ``File->Load Data`` as before. Now select the ``T1 map`` and ``T2 map``
checkboxes, and select the appropriate data sets from the dropdown menus. The result should look like this:

.. image:: /screenshots/cest_tutorial_analysis.png

Output section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: /screenshots/cest_tutorial_output.png

By default, CESTR* maps will be output, with the added option to output individual parameter maps, as well as fitted 
curves. As shown above, we have set both of these options, so that fitted data can be properly interrogated. 

Running model-based analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Run`` button is used to start the analysis. The output data will be loaded into Quantiphyse but if you would
also like to save it in a file, you can select the ``Save copy of output data`` checkbox and choose a folder
to save it in.

.. image:: /screenshots/cest_tutorial_run.png
  
.. note::
    If you are participating in a course and choose to save the output data, make sure you save it to a folder in 
    your home directory, *not* to a folder in the ``course_data`` input data directory. You don't have permission 
    to write to this directory!

Visualising Processed Data
--------------------------

If you re-select the ``Voxel analysis`` widget which we used at the start to look at the CEST signal in the 
input data, you can see the model prediction overlaid onto the data. By clicking on different voxels you
can get an idea of how well the model has fitted your data.

.. image:: /screenshots/cest_tutorial_modelfit.png

For each non-water pool included in the model there will be a corresponding CESTR* map output (here amide and a 
macromolecular pool). You can see a summary of all of these values by clicking on the ``Non timeseries data``
underneath the timeseries plot:

.. image:: /screenshots/cest_tutorial_params.png

Here we are most interested in the behaviour of the Amide pool; cest_rstar_Amide. 

.. image:: /screenshots/cest/tumour_amide_rstar.png

It may help to adjust the colour map levels using the |levels| button in the data set view options
below the main viewer window - try a display range of 0 to 15. We have also selected the brain mask as the 'View ROI' which only
displays the part of the data set within this ROI.

.. |levels| image:: /screenshots/overlay_levels.png 

We can extract quantitative metrics for this using regions of interest (ROIs). Before doing this it can 
help to apply some smoothing to the data. From the menu select ``Widgets->Processing->Smoothing`` and set
the options to smooth ``cest_rstar_Amide`` with a smoothing kernel size of 0.4mm:

.. image:: /screenshots/cest_tutorial_smooth.png

The output of this smoothing appears as follows:

.. image:: /screenshots/cest/tumour_amide_rstar_smoothed.png

Extracting quantitative Metrics
-------------------------------

We have prepared an ROI for the ischaemic region in the file:

  - ``tumour_rim.nii``

Beyond CESTR*
-------------

The minimum outputs from running model-based analysis are the model-fitted z-spectra, and CESTR* maps for non-water 
pools, as defined in your model setup. If the Parameter Maps option is highlighted then for each pool, including 
water, there will be additional maps of proton concentration and exchange rate (from which CESTR* is calculated), as 
well as frequency offset (ppm). For water, the offset map represents the correction for any field inhomogeneities. 

If the ``Allow uncertainty in T1/T2 values`` is set then fitted maps of T1 and T2 will be available for each pool. 
Naming conventions follow the order the pools are defined in the QuantiCEST setup panel. 

Viewing data without the water baseline
---------------------------------------

Rather than doing a full model-based analysis as described in section Bayesian model-based analysis, QuantiCEST also 
has the option simply remove the water baseline from the raw data, allowing you to directly view or quantify the 
smaller non-water peaks in the acquired CEST volume. Baseline removal is done using the Lorentzian Difference
Analysis (LDA) option in QuantiCEST - this is available by selecting the alternative tab in the box containing
the ``Run`` button.

.. image:: /screenshots/cest_tutorial_lda.png

LDA works by fitting a subset of the raw CEST data (within ±1ppm, and beyond ±30ppm) to a water pool,
and then subtracting this model fit from the data. This leaves behind the smaller non-water 
peaks in the data, called a Lorentzian Difference spectrum. QuantiCEST outputs this as ``lorenz_diff.nii.gz``.
This can be viewed in the ``Voxel Analysis`` widget alongside the data signal and the model-based fit:

.. image:: /screenshots/cest_tutorial_lda_curve.png

Running QuantiCEST from the command line
----------------------------------------

Here we have covered basic model-based analysis of CEST data using the interactive GUI. If you have multiple data sets
it may be desirable to automate this analysis so that the same processing steps can be run on several data sets from
the command line, without interactive use.

Although this is beyond the scope of this tutorial, it can be set up relatively simply. The batch processing options
for the analysis you have set up can be displayed by clicing on the following button at the top of the QuantiCEST 
widget |batchbutton|. For more information see documentation for :ref:`batch`.
